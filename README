RATIONALE

•  It's source control friendly and it's easy for a user to
   resolve merge conflicts and identify changes.

•  Rendering can take a very long time. With this approach,
   the user can use Make to only rerender parts that have
   been changes.

•  No room for buggy GUI:s, which currently is a problem on
   the large video editors for Linux.

•  Less chance that the user makes a change by mistake
   without noticing it, such as moving a clip in the editor
   by mistake instead of for example resizing.

•  Even old crappy computers can be used for large projects.

•  Very easy to utilise command line image editors for modify
   frames, or to add your own tools for custom effects.
