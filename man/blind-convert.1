.B blind-convert
converts a video to use the pixel format
.I pixel-format
(all arguments are joined together with
a blank space). Available formats are:
.TP
.B xyza f
Unscaled CIE XYZ with unscaled alpha channel, in the
order, X, Y, Z, alpha. Each subpixel value is stored
as a single-precision floating-point number using the
local machines endianness.
.TP
.B xyza !f
Unscaled CIE XYZ with unscaled alpha channel, in the
order, X, Y, Z, alpha. Each subpixel value is stored
as a double-precision floating-point number using the
local machines endianness. This is the default format
in other commands.
.TP
.B xyza
Unscaled CIE XYZ with unscaled alpha channel, in the
order, X, Y, Z, alpha. Each subpixel value is stored
in the same format as in the input stream.
.TP
.B f
The same colour space as the input stream, but with
each subpixel value is stored as a single-precision
floating-point number using the local machines
endianness.
.TP
.B !f
The same colour space as the input stream, but with
