.TH BLIND-INVERT-MATRIX 1 blind
.SH NAME
blind-invert-matrix - Invert matrix-vidoes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B blind-invert-matrix
[-e]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B blind-invert-matrix
reads a video representing a matrix from
stdin, inverts it, and prints the results
to stdout.
.P
The matrix must be at least as wide as it
is tall. If the matrix is wider than it is
tall, it is treated as an augmented matrix,
and the unaugmented square matrix is
eliminated to the identity matrix and the
resuling augment is printed.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -e
Apply optimisation that assumes all channels
are identical.
.SH NOTES
.B blind-invert-matrix
fails if it encounters a non-invertable
matrix, however, this is not always the
case.
