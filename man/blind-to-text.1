.B blind-to-text
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B blind-to-text
reads a video from stdin and prints it
in text format to stdout. The first line
in the output is the head. It will contain:
the number of frames, <space>, the width,
<space>, the height, <space>, and the pixel
format. The result of the lines will be
one line per pixel, each of these line will
contain the values of the pixel's colur in
textual representation of a floating-point
value, each separated by a <space>. The
order of the values are: X, Y, Z, and alpha,
where X, Y, and Z are the parameters of the
colour's CIE XYZ representation.
.P
If the width of the video is
.I w
and the height of the video is
.IR h ,
the first
.I w
lines after the head are the pixels in the
first row in the first frame of the video,
the following
.I w
lines are the pixels in the second row,
and so on until the the
.IR w*h :th
line, after the head, where the second
frame begins. The pixels are printed
from left to right, from top to bottom,
and from first frame to last frame.
