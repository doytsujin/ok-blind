blind-transform		transformation by matrix multiplication, -t for tiling, -s for improve quality
				on downscaling (pixels' neighbours must not change)
blind-chroma-key	replace a chroma with transparency
blind-primary-key	replace a primary with transparency, -g for greyscaled images
blind-primaries		given three selectable primaries split the video into three side-by-side which
				only one primary active
blind-apply-map		remap pixels (distortion) using the X and Y values, -t for tiling, -s for
				improve quality on downscaling (pixels' neighbours must not change)
blind-apply-kernel	apply a convolution matrix
