blind-transform		affine transformation by matrix multiplication, -[xy] for tiling, -s for
				improve quality on downscaling (pixels' neighbours must not change)
blind-primary-key	replace a primary with transparency, -g for greyscaled images
blind-colour-matrix	create colour space conversion matrix
blind-apply-map		remap pixels (distortion) using the X and Y values, -[xy] for tiling, -s for
				improve quality on downscaling (pixels' neighbours must not change)
blind-find-frame	a graphical tool for locating frames, should highlight key frames, and
				play audio. Should support both regular videos files and uivf
				finding key frames: ffprobe -show_frames (lists all frames)
blind-invert-chroma	invert the chroma
blind-from-sent		convert a sent presentation to a one-frame-per-slide blind video

blind-temporal-arithm	blind-arithm but over all frames in a video instead of over all streams
blind-apply-icc		apply ICC profile to video
blind-convex-gradient	create a gradient in the shape of a convex lens
blind-concave-gradient	create a gradient in the shape of a concave lens
			(convexo-concave gradient is not necessary is blind-convex-gradient
			 or blind-concave-gradient can be combined with blind-arithm for this)
blind-preview		a graphical tool for previewing the output of a pipeline
				should display the output for a selected frame or image
				should have sliders to tune environment variables

blind-from-video: add options to:
	* just run ffmpeg just print the output
	* convert output from the option above to blind's format,
	  but stop after a selected number of frames
	* like above, but instead of convert, simply read and
	  print to stdout (up to user to direct to /dev/null
	  for discarding)

blind-cone-gradient: add ability to make gradient superelliptic

blind-arithm: add support for multiple streams

Add [-j jobs] to blind-from-video and blind-to-video.

long double is slightly faster than long.
long double (xyza q) could be added as another format.
unsigned char (xyza 8) could be added as another format, it's probably good for previewing


HELP REQUIRED:
	blind-z-map			create a Z-map video from two or more videos
	blind-track			track the movement of a point
	blind-transition-mosaic		gradually turn a mosaic pattern into another
