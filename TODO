blind-transform		affine transformation by matrix multiplication, -t for tiling, -s for
				improve quality on downscaling (pixels' neighbours must not change).
blind-chroma-key	replace a chroma with transparency.
blind-primary-key	replace a primary with transparency, -g for greyscaled images.
blind-primaries		given three selectable primaries split the video into three side-by-side which
				only one primary active.
blind-apply-map		remap pixels (distortion) using the X and Y values, -t for tiling, -s for
				improve quality on downscaling (pixels' neighbours must not change).
blind-apply-kernel	apply a convolution matrix.
blind-find-frame	a graphical tool for locating frames, should highlight key frames, and
				play audio. Should support both regular videos files and uivf.
blind-affine-colour	apply an affine transformation to the colour of each pixel,
				-a for ignoring the alpha channel,
				-l for linear transformation,
				-p for transforming each pixel with their own transformation.
blind-translate		animated translation
blind-invert-chroma	invert the chroma

Add [-j jobs] to blind-from-video and blind-to-video.
